Converter_Bok_to_Access â€” Summary and Next Steps

Summary

- Purpose: A desktop conversion tool designed to process legacy Shamela desktop book files (the very old local Shamela collection) and export them into Microsoft Access (.mdb/.accdb) databases.
- Role: Prepares the historical Shamela collection for automated ingestion into the BMS platform by producing structured Access databases that reflect the fields and relationships expected by BMS.
- Key behavior: Reads legacy file formats, extracts metadata (title, author, publisher, year, sections, page ranges), normalizes text encoding, and writes results into Access tables with a schema designed to match BMS import expectations.

Why this matters

- The Shamela desktop collection is an old offline library format; converting it into a normalized Access database is an efficient intermediate step before bulk uploading to the live BMS SQL database.
- Ensuring the Access schema mirrors BMS reduces transformation work later and minimizes data loss.

Next steps to finish and harden

1. Repository review
   - Clone and run existing scripts to confirm runtime requirements and discover any broken dependencies or hard-coded paths.
2. Schema verification
   - Extract a sample Access output and compare field names/types with BMS database schema. Produce a mapping document.
3. Encoding and normalization
   - Add robust text normalization for Arabic (Unicode NFC/NFKC), remove legacy character artifacts, and standardize punctuation and diacritics.
4. Error handling & logging
   - Add structured logging for processed files, skipped records, and transformation errors. Implement retry/backoff for transient failures.
5. Tests & sample dataset
   - Create a small sample dataset (10-50 books) with expected Access output and unit tests to validate correctness.
6. CLI improvements
   - Add command-line options for input folder, output file, logging level, and dry-run mode.
7. Packaging & instructions
   - Add a README in the repo, requirements file, and a minimal tutorial showing an end-to-end conversion example.
8. Integration with BMS pipeline
   - Produce a validated Access file and hand off to the `upload_Access_to_Database_sql` tool for ingestion.

Optional improvements

- Add a preview/export to CSV/JSON for quick inspection.
- Provide a small GUI wrapper for curator use.
- Parallelize file processing for large library sets.
