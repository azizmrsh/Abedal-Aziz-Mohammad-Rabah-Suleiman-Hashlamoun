upload_Access_to_Database_sql â€” Summary and Next Steps

Summary

- Purpose: A migration tool that uploads Microsoft Access database files into the BMS SQL database.
- Role: Acts as the ingestion step to bring converted Shamela content (produced by `Converter_Bok_to_Access`) into the live BMS schema with minimal transformation.
- Key behavior: Connects to Access databases, maps tables/fields to BMS tables, validates & sanitizes records, and performs batch inserts/updates into the target SQL database.

Why this matters

- This tool closes the loop: it ensures that legacy content converted into Access format is reliably and safely moved into the BMS SQL database with schema alignment and validation.

Next steps to finish and harden

1. Repo & dependency check
   - Clone and run the scripts to discover required Python/ODBC drivers and confirm connectivity methods (pyodbc, pypyodbc, or similar).
2. Create schema mapping
   - Produce or codify a mapping file (YAML/JSON) that declares how Access tables and columns map to BMS tables and fields.
3. Connection and credentials
   - Add secure configuration for DB credentials (environment variables, .env, or vault) and avoid storing secrets in repo.
4. Transactional uploads
   - Wrap uploads in transactions and provide rollback on validation failure to keep the BMS DB consistent.
5. Idempotency and deduplication
   - Implement primary-key checks or deduplication logic to avoid duplicate inserts when reprocessing the same Access file.
6. Performance and batching
   - Use batch inserts and tune commit sizes for best performance; add progress reporting for large runs.
7. Validation and transformation
   - Integrate validation rules (required fields, character limits, Unicode normalization) and minimal transformations required by BMS.
8. Tests & staging
   - Provide a staging/test mode that uploads to a sandbox DB for verification before pushing to production.
9. Documentation & runbook
   - Add a clear README with setup steps, connection examples, and a runbook for operators.

Optional improvements

- Add a dry-run mode that emits SQL INSERT statements or generates a delta report instead of applying changes.
- Provide an automated pipeline step to trigger this tool after `Converter_Bok_to_Access` completes, with artifact passing (e.g., upload Access file path).
